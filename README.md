# Godot - 2D Horror Demo

This demonstration combines the following interesting aspects:
- Full 2D Tilemap with map collision
- 2D movement with WASD and the arrow keys
- A _depressing_ (lol) atmosphere and field of view built around a Light2D and Light Occluders
- Deadly enemie(s) with pathfinding
- Sprinting using the SHIFT key including exhaustion and a stamina bar

To run the demo you can either download this repository or clone it. You will then need to import the folder into the latest Godot (>=3.3.3) or scan for it. That's basically all you need to do. Then just go ahead and press "Launch" or F5 in the editor.

**A simple live demo is available here: https://phoenix1747.github.io/Godot-Horror-Demo-2D/**
